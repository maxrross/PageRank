# PageRank
PageRank is a command-line based C++ application which applies a simplified link analysis algorithm to rank web page entries based on their in-degrees. Using a graph representation of web pages, it calculates the rank of each page based on the weighted rank of incoming links. The graph of the web pages is implemented using an adjacency list, a choice made to optimize the space complexity of the algorithm. The application ultimately outputs the page ranks for each URL in alphabetical order, after performing the specified number of power iterations to accurately reflect the influence of each web page.
